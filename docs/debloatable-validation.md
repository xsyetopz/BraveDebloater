# Debloatable Source Validation

BraveDebloater only adds policy names that can be checked against Brave's own policy sources.

## Source Files

Official sources used for this pass:

- Brave Help Center, Group Policy, updated February 12, 2026: https://support.brave.app/hc/en-us/articles/360039248271-Group-Policy
- Latest Brave policy templates zip: https://brave-browser-downloads.s3.brave.com/latest/policy_templates.zip

Downloaded template evidence:

- Template version: `150.1.93.96`
- Archive timestamp: June 23, 2026
- Checked files: `VERSION` and `windows/admx/brave.admx`

Targeted Reddit, Brave Community, and GitHub searches did not produce a newer or more authoritative debloatable-policy source than Brave's Help Center and template zip.

## What Changed

The manifest version in `config/policies.json` changed from `148.1.91.121` to `150.1.93.96`.

These official-template policies were added because they match BraveDebloater's scope:

- `EmailAliasesEnabled = 0`
- `IPFSEnabled = 0`
- `PromotionalTabsEnabled = 0`

These official-template policies were checked and left out:

- `TorDisabled`: disables a privacy feature instead of removing bloat.
- `DefaultBraveRemember1PStorageSetting`: changes storage behavior instead of removing an extra surface.
- `BraveShieldsDisabledForUrls` and `BraveShieldsEnabledForUrls`: Shield URL lists stay blocked by the safety rules.

## Platform Notes

`Windows`, `macOS`, and `Linux` are validated from the official Brave ADMX template. Brave documents desktop support for Chromium policies plus Brave-specific policies, and documents native policy storage for macOS and Linux.

`Android` is marked `mdm-no-template`. Brave documents Android as MDM-controlled and says it does not currently provide MDM templates for Android.

`iOS` is limited to the Brave-documented mobile policy list:

- `BravePlaylistEnabled`
- `BraveVPNDisabled`
- `BraveNewsDisabled`
- `BraveTalkDisabled`
- `BraveRewardsDisabled`
- `BraveAIChatEnabled`

iOS/iPadOS export validation now reads that allow-list from the manifest instead of a hardcoded list.

## New Check

`scripts/Test-LatestPolicyTemplates.ps1` validates a downloaded official template zip.

It checks that:

- the manifest version matches the zip `VERSION`;
- every manifest policy exists in `windows/admx/brave.admx`;
- every iOS allow-listed policy is defined in the manifest.

## Validation Commands

Download the current Brave template zip:

```powershell
curl -L -o /tmp/brave-policy-templates.zip https://brave-browser-downloads.s3.brave.com/latest/policy_templates.zip
```

Run the source-backed template check:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File ./scripts/Test-LatestPolicyTemplates.ps1 -TemplateZipPath /tmp/brave-policy-templates.zip
```

Run the local checks:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File ./scripts/Test-PolicyManifest.ps1
pwsh -NoProfile -File ./scripts/Test-Behavior.ps1
```

The template validator uses a local zip file on purpose. CI can download the current zip before running it, but normal offline checks do not need network access.
